// This registry started empty on `dev` (no page rendered `PageFamilyFrame` yet) and every existing
// `context-row.test.tsx` case exercises it through a MOCK, never the real export — so before this
// file, nothing proved the real array's content once a surface actually populated it. #191 is that
// first surface: it must both render `PageFamilyFrame` (home-page.tsx) AND register itself here, or
// ContextRow renders a duplicate orientation signal alongside Home's own status row (Experience-
// Contract Rule 1). This is the direct check on the real, unmocked registry.
