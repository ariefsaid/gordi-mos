// Feature flags — temporarily hide sections that aren't ready for the first rollout
// (owner-directed 2026-06-17). Each flag gates EVERYTHING for its section: the rail nav
// entry, the route (redirects to My Week when off), and any My Week surfaces that reference
// it. Flip a flag to `true` to fully restore the section — no other change needed.
