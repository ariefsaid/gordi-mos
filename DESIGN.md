# Design System: Gordi MOS

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Quiet Control Surface."**

This is the existing, owner-approved RIS Portal look — a shadcn/Radix-derived, near-monochrome control surface — adopted wholesale as the Gordi MOS's visual identity. It is **preserved, not reinvented.** The system was extracted verbatim from the RIS reference mockups (`sales-pipeline-reference.html`, `budget-reference.html`), both of which carry one identical token block ("Token System A", shadcn-vue HSL, light scheme). Every value below is reverse-engineered from those files; nothing here is a new brand, palette, or font.

The personality is **calm, dense, and data-first.** The surface is white-on-near-white: a single blue carries every interactive affordance against a field of warm-cool greys, so the eye goes straight to numbers, status, and the one action that matters. Density is deliberate — controls are compact (32px tall), but table rows breathe (54px) so financial figures are scannable. This is an operator's tool for a contract- and project-based business: the owner reviews budgets, procurement, and pipeline on desktop and phone, and the design optimizes for trust in the data over decoration. It explicitly rejects the "AI SaaS marketing" aesthetic: no dark-mode-with-purple-gradients, no neon, no glassmorphism panels, no oversized hero type, no shadow-heavy "floating card" soup.

**Key Characteristics:**
- One blue accent (`primary`, `hsl(221 83% 53%)`) does all the interactive work; everything else is neutral.
- Borders, not shadows, define structure. Shadows are a *response to state* (hover, focus, overlay), never decoration.
- Tight 8px-derived radius scale; `--radius: 0.5rem` (8px) is the spine, with `calc()` derivations for nested elements.
- Inter everywhere; tabular-nums for all money and metrics; SF Mono for IDs/codes only.
- Status is communicated by a small colored dot + tinted pill, not by loud fills.

## 2. Colors

A near-monochrome system built on shadcn-vue's HSL roles. The hue spine is a cool neutral (`240`); the only saturated color in normal use is the primary blue. Status colors (destructive/warning/success) appear only on data state, and a single categorical violet is reserved for KPI/avatar/timeline accents — never as an action color. **Light scheme only** in the source; no dark `:root` block was present (see Open Questions).

### Primary
- **Action Blue** (`hsl(221.2 83.2% 53.3%)`): The one interactive color. Primary buttons, active nav item (at 10% tint + full-color text), selected rows (7% tint), focus ring, checkbox fill, links-in-context, the "current" step in steppers, sticky-tab indicators, and the toast accent stripe. Its foreground (`hsl(0 0% 98%)`, near-white) sits on solid blue. **Used sparingly** — see The One Blue Rule.

### Secondary (categorical accent — not an action color)
- **Categorical Violet** (`hsl(262 83% 58%)`): Reserved for non-interactive categorization only: a KPI icon tile (`violet` variant), the user avatar gradient (blue→violet), and select timeline/legend dots. Never use it for buttons, links, or anything clickable.

### Tertiary (status semantics — data-driven only)
- **Destructive Red** (`hsl(0 84.2% 60.2%)`, fg `hsl(0 0% 98%)`): Errors, destructive buttons, "lost"/negative status, overdue/stale ages, negative deltas, notification dot. Tinted variants at ~10–12% for chips/icon tiles.
- **Warning Amber** (`hsl(43 96% 56%)`, fg `hsl(22 78% 26%)`): "Aging"/"overdue" warnings, mid-threshold bars, caution KPI tiles. Note the deep-brown foreground for AA text contrast on amber tints.
- **Success Green** (`hsl(142 71% 45%)`, fg `hsl(0 0% 98%)`): "Won"/positive status, completed steps, positive deltas, high-threshold bars, the "Live" pulse tag, success toasts.

### Neutral
- **Background** (`hsl(0 0% 100%)`, pure white): App background and header. Note the main scroll area uses `secondary` at 35% (`hsl(240 4.8% 95.9% / 0.35)`) to lift cards off the page.
- **Foreground** (`hsl(240 10% 3.9%)`, near-black): Primary text.
- **Card / Popover** (`hsl(0 0% 100%)`): Elevated surfaces (cards, table body, rail, popovers, toasts) — pure white against the tinted main area.
- **Secondary / Muted / Accent** (`hsl(240 4.8% 95.9%)`, light cool grey): These three share one value but differ in intent. `secondary` = quiet fills (segmented controls, count pills, progress tracks). `muted` pairs with `muted-foreground` (`hsl(240 3.8% 46.1%)`) for de-emphasized text (labels, captions, breadcrumb, sub-values). `accent` is the hover wash on interactive neutral surfaces (rail items, ghost buttons, row hover, control hover).
- **Border / Input** (`hsl(240 5.9% 90%)`): All hairline dividers, card outlines, and field strokes — one value. Table row dividers soften to 70% opacity.

### Named Rules
**The One Blue Rule.** The primary blue is the only saturated interactive color and should touch ≤10% of any screen. If two things on a screen are blue and only one is the main action, one of them is wrong. Categorical violet and status colors are NOT substitutes for it.

**The Tinted-Status Rule.** Status is shown as a 6px colored dot plus a pill tinted at ~10–18% of the status hue with a darkened text variant — never a fully saturated solid fill behind body text. Solid status fills are reserved for the destructive *button* only.

**The Single-Border Rule.** `border` and `input` are the same value on purpose. Never introduce a second border color to "separate" regions; use the `secondary`/`card` surface contrast or spacing instead.

## 3. Typography

**Display / Body / UI Font:** Inter (with `system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif` fallback).
**Mono Font:** SF Mono (with `ui-monospace, "JetBrains Mono", Menlo, monospace`) — IDs, codes, and the `⌘K` glyph only.

**Character:** One humanist-grotesque sans does all the talking. The voice is neutral and engineered, never expressive — Inter's tight `letterSpacing` at large sizes (`-0.02em` on titles) keeps headings crisp and compact. Base size is 14px with a 1.45 line-height; the app reads like a well-set spreadsheet, not a landing page. **`tabular-nums` (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` + `font-feature-settings: "tnum"`) is mandatory on all money, percentages, counts, deltas, and metric values** so columns align and figures don't jitter on update.

### Hierarchy
- **Page Title** (700, 24px, lh 1.2, ls -0.02em): One per page, in `.page-head`. KPI values reuse ~23px/700 for the headline number.
- **Heading** (700, 20px, lh 1.25, ls -0.01em): Section/card titles, kanban column titles (~13.5px/700 in compact contexts).
- **Subheading** (600, 18px, lh 1.3): Sub-section headers inside detail panels.
- **Body** (400, 14px, lh 1.45): Default text. Controls and table cells run 13.5px; the base run is 14px.
- **Label** (600, 12px, lh 1.3): Status pills, badge counts, dense metadata, button text at small sizes.
- **Overline** (600, 11px, lh 1.3, ls 0.06em, UPPERCASE): Rail group labels and table column headers (`thead th` at 11.5px). The uppercase + tracked treatment is the system's section-divider voice.
- **Mono** (500, 13px): Project codes / IDs (`.pc-id`), keyboard hints (`.kbd`, `⌘K`). Never for prose or numbers-in-tables (those use tabular Inter).

### Named Rules
**The Tabular-Numbers Rule.** Every figure that can change or be compared (currency, %, counts, deltas, ages) is `tabular-nums`. Non-negotiable in tables, KPIs, kanban totals, and funnel values.

**The Mono-For-Identifiers Rule.** SF Mono appears only on machine identifiers (deal/project codes) and keyboard chips. Money is Inter-tabular, not mono.

## 4. Elevation

This is a **borders-first, flat-by-default** system. Depth is conveyed primarily by 1px borders and surface-tone contrast (white `card` floating on the `secondary`/35% main area), not by shadow. Shadows are small, low-opacity, and almost always a *response to state* — a card lifts ~`0 2px 10px` on hover, a primary button carries a faint `0 1px 2px` brand-tinted shadow, segmented "on" states get a `0 1px 2px` lift to read as pressed. Only true overlays (popover menus, toasts, tooltips) carry a real drop shadow, because they genuinely float above the page. All shadow colors are a desaturated near-black (`hsl(240 6–10% ~8% / low-alpha)`), never pure black.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **State lift** (`box-shadow: 0 2px 10px hsl(240 6% 10% / 0.06)`): Card / KPI tile on hover.
- **Pressed/selected lift** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px hsl(240 6% 10% / 0.10–0.14)`): Active segment in a segmented control; the live-layout switcher's selected pane button.
- **Brand button shadow** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px hsl(var(--primary) / 0.25)`): Primary button at rest — a faint tinted seat.
- **Kanban card hover** (`box-shadow: 0 4px 14px hsl(240 6% 10% / 0.10)`): Slightly deeper than KPI hover; cards are draggable, so they lift more.
- **Overlay** (`box-shadow: 0 10px 30px hsl(240 10% 8% / 0.16), 0 2px 6px hsl(240 10% 8% / 0.08)`): Popover row-menu. Toasts/tooltips use a single `0 10px 30px … / 0.16` (tooltip darker, `0 8px 24px hsl(240 10% 4% / 0.4)` on its dark surface).

### Named Rules
**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** Surfaces are flat at rest, defined by their border and tone. A shadow appears only as a response to state (hover, pressed, focus) or because the element genuinely floats (popover, toast, tooltip). If a static card has a drop shadow, it is wrong — give it a border instead.

**The No-Pure-Black-Shadow Rule.** Shadow color is always desaturated near-black at low alpha (`hsl(240 …% ~8–10% / 0.04–0.16)`). Never `rgba(0,0,0,…)` at high opacity — that reads as a 2014 app.

## 5. Components

All interactive controls are **32px tall** ("h-8") with `md` (8px) radius unless noted; data table rows are deliberately roomier at 54px. Nested radii use `calc(var(--radius) - 2px/3px)` so inner corners sit inside outer ones.

### Buttons
- **Shape:** 8px radius (`{rounded.md}`), 32px tall, `0 12px` padding, 7px gap to a 15px icon. Small variant (`btn-sm`): 28px tall, 13px text. Icon-only: 32px square.
- **Primary:** `primary` bg, `primary-foreground` text, faint brand shadow at rest. Hover → `primary` at 90% (`hsl(var(--primary) / 0.9)`).
- **Outline:** `background` fill, `input` border, `foreground` text. Hover → `accent` wash.
- **Ghost:** transparent, `foreground` text. Hover → `accent` wash. Used for icon buttons in the header.
- **Destructive:** `destructive` bg, `destructive-foreground` text. Hover → 90%. The only solid status fill in the system; reserved for irreversible actions (Mark lost, Delete).
- **Focus:** global `:focus-visible` ring — `outline: 2px solid {colors.ring}; outline-offset: 2px`.
- **Disabled (gap — see Open Questions):** not defined in source; proposed `opacity: 0.5; cursor: not-allowed; pointer-events: none`.

### Badges / Status Pills
- **Status pill:** 22px tall, full radius, 12px/600 label, with a leading 6px colored `dot`. Background = status hue at ~10–18%, text = a darkened variant of the hue for AA contrast (applied via the named CSS token — see below). Variants observed: `open` (blue), `won` (green), `lost` (red), `overdue` (amber). Default/neutral badge uses `secondary` bg + `muted-foreground` text.
- **Count badge** (nav rail / kanban): `secondary` bg + `muted-foreground` text, full radius; active nav item flips to `primary/15%` bg + `primary` text. Kanban column count adds a 1px border on `background`.

#### Status-pill text tokens (Wave-6 H3 — named source of truth in `index.css` `:root`)
The darkened-AA text values for the four non-neutral pill variants are defined as named CSS custom properties. The `StatusPill` component applies them as `hsl(var(--token))` inline styles — the token IS the applied value.

| Token | HSL value | Pill variant | Contrast (on white) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--status-open-text` | `221 75% 38%` | `open` (blue) | ≥4.5:1 AA |
| `--status-won-text` | `142 64% 30%` | `won` (green) | ≥4.5:1 AA |
| `--status-lost-text` | `0 72% 45%` | `lost` (red) | ≥4.5:1 AA |
| `--status-violet-text` | `262 60% 42%` | `violet` | 7.4:1 AA |

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 8px radius (`{rounded.md}`). When a card sits directly above a toolbar+table assembly, top corners are rounded and the seam is squared (`var(--radius) var(--radius) 0 0`).
- **Background:** `card` (white) on the `secondary/35%` main area; the contrast is what makes it read as elevated.
- **Border:** always a 1px `border`. This is the primary depth cue.
- **Shadow:** none at rest; `state lift` on hover for interactive cards (KPI, kanban).
- **Internal Padding:** 16px standard (`{spacing.4}`); compact cards (kanban) use ~11px.
- **The KPI Tile** (signature): white card, 16px padding, with a top row of [30px tinted icon tile] + [label, `muted-foreground` 12.5px] + [help `?`], a 23px/700 tabular value, and a foot row with a tinted delta chip (`up` green / `down` red / `neutral` grey) plus a `muted` "vs." comparison. Negative values turn `destructive`.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** `background` fill, 1px `input` border, 8px radius, 32px tall, `0 10px` padding. Placeholder = `muted-foreground`. The search-mini and the header `cmdk` are the canonical field shells; inner `<input>` is borderless/transparent and inherits the font.
- **Focus:** `:focus-visible` ring (`2px {colors.ring}`, 2px offset). The `cmdk` also shifts its border on hover (`muted-foreground/50%`).
- **Checkbox:** 16px, 1.5px `input` border, 4px radius; checked → `primary` fill + `primary` border + white check. Exposed with `role="checkbox"` + `aria-checked` + `tabindex`.
- **Error / Disabled (gap — see Open Questions):** no error-state field styling in source. Proposed: error border = `destructive`, helper text = `destructive`; disabled = `secondary` bg + `muted-foreground` text + `not-allowed`.

### Data Table (signature)
- **Header cells:** sticky, `card` bg, 38px tall, Overline type (11.5px/600 uppercase, 0.03em, `muted-foreground`), bottom `border`. Sortable headers gain `foreground` on hover with a 12px sort glyph. Numeric columns right-align; selection/center columns center.
- **Body cells:** 54px tall ("roomy rows — breathe"), 12px padding, divider = `border/70%`. Row hover → `accent/60%`; selected → `primary/7%`; expanded → `accent/50%`. Row `⋯` menu button is hidden until row hover.
- **In-cell patterns:** project cell (28px colored icon + 2-line name/code, code in mono); money (`tabular`, sub-values `muted`); win-% bar (track `secondary`, fill `success`/`warning`/`destructive` by threshold); age chip (turns `warning-foreground`/`destructive` when aging/stale).
- **Footer:** totals row, `secondary/40%` bg, 1.5px top border, `tabular` values; count in `muted`.
- **Toolbar / Action bar:** `card` bg seamed to the table top (`… … 0 0`), 10–12px padding, holds `control` chips (32px, `input` border, `muted` icon, chevron), a `seg` segmented filter (`secondary` track, "on" = white pill + lift), a `search-mini`, and trailing icon controls. Selection mode swaps the default controls for a bulk-action cluster on a `primary/6%` wash with a count `pill`.

### Kanban Card (signature)
- White `card`, 8px radius, ~11px padding, faint `0 1px 2px` rest shadow. Hover → `0 4px 14px` lift + `muted-foreground/35%` border; active → `scale(.992)`; selected → `primary` border + `primary` ring + `primary/4%` fill; a drag grip fades in on hover. Holds a 26px colored icon, name (13px/600) + customer (`muted`), a 15px/700 tabular value, a win-% chip, and a foot row (border-top `border/70%`) with age + owner avatar + mini status pill. Columns sit in a horizontal-scroll grid of `minmax(290px, 1fr)` tracks on a `secondary/50%` column body with a sticky blurred header.

### Lifecycle / Stage Stepper (signature)
- A horizontal "journey" tracker: equal-flex steps each with a 6px rounded `jbar` (track = `secondary`), a label, and a date. `done` step → bar `success`, label `foreground`/600; `current` step → bar `primary`, label `foreground`/600. Used for budget version lifecycle and the deal stage journey in detail panels. The funnel/stage-summary band is the macro analog: 4 connected `card` segments with conversion-arrow chips between them; selected stage gets `primary/6%` + an inset `primary` bottom rule.

### Navigation
- **Rail (sidebar):** 224px (`--rail-w`), `card` bg, right `border`. Brand block (56px, matches header) with a 28px `primary` logo square. Grouped items under Overline group labels. **Nav item:** 36px tall, `sm`-derived radius (`calc(var(--radius) - 2px)`), 13.5px/500, 17px stroke-2 icon, optional trailing count badge. Hover → `accent`; active → `primary/10%` bg + `primary` text + 600 weight + `aria-current="page"`. Foot section (border-top) holds Settings.
- **Top bar (header):** 56px (`--header-h`), `background` bg, bottom `border`. Holds the mobile menu button, a breadcrumb (`muted` links → `foreground` on hover, `>` separators, bold `current`), a flexible spacer, the `cmdk` search button (`⌘K` chip), an icon button with a `destructive` notification dot, and a user chip (avatar gradient blue→violet + name/role, hidden on phone).
- **Mobile:** below 920px the rail collapses (`--rail-w: 0`) and a hamburger appears; `cmdk` shrinks to an icon; user name/role hide.
- **DataTable reflow (OD-W4-4):** the DataTable **single-renders** — at `md` (768 px) it renders the `<table>`; below `md` it renders a stacked card list instead. Exactly ONE branch is in the DOM at a time (chosen by `useIsDesktop()` reading `(min-width: 768px)` synchronously at first paint, so no flash of the wrong branch on mobile). These are two separate breakpoints — 920 px for the rail collapse, 768 px for the table→card reflow. Card anatomy: first column = title/activation button, remaining columns = `<dl>` label:value grid. Because only one branch renders, each cell appears once in the AT tree — **no `aria-hidden` on either branch** (the unrendered branch is simply absent). Touch targets on card affordances extend to ≥44 px via `.touch-target`.

### Tabs / Segmented Controls
- **Inline segmented (`seg`):** 32px track on `secondary`, buttons 28px, "on" = white `background` pill + `foreground` + 600 + `0 1px 2px` lift. `role="tablist"`/`role="tab"`/`aria-selected`. Used for stage filters.
- **Large segmented (layout switcher):** 40px sticky bar (`abc-seg`), 34px buttons with a letter chip; "on" → white pill + lift, letter chip flips to `primary`. Sticky with a `backdrop-filter` blur over the `secondary/35%` page.

### Overlays
- **Popover menu (`#rowmenu`):** `popover` bg, `border`, 8px radius, overlay shadow, 5px padding; 32px menu items, `accent` hover, `danger` items in `destructive`, hairline `menu-sep`.
- **Toast:** `popover` bg, `border` + 3px left accent stripe (`primary`, or `success` for ok), overlay shadow, bottom-right, slide-in. 
- **Tooltip (`#tip`):** dark surface (`hsl(240 10% 8%)`), near-white text, 7px radius, `0 8px 24px / 0.4` shadow, max 280px; bold title with optional dot, `tabular` key/value rows.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** drive every interactive affordance with the one `primary` blue, and keep it under ~10% of any screen (The One Blue Rule).
- **Do** define structure with the single 1px `border` (`hsl(240 5.9% 90%)`) and surface-tone contrast (white `card` on `secondary/35%` main), not with shadows.
- **Do** apply `tabular-nums` to every figure — currency, %, counts, deltas, ages — in tables, KPIs, kanban, and funnels.
- **Do** show status as a 6px dot + a tinted pill (status hue ~10–18% bg, darkened text), and reserve solid fills for the `destructive` button only.
- **Do** keep controls at 32px ("h-8") and table body rows roomy at 54px; use the 8px radius spine with `calc()` derivations for nested corners.
- **Do** use SF Mono only for machine IDs/codes and the `⌘K` chip; everything else is Inter.
- **Do** expose the global `:focus-visible` ring (`2px solid {colors.ring}`, 2px offset) on every focusable element, and keep `role`/`aria-selected`/`aria-checked`/`aria-current` on tabs, checkboxes, and nav.
- **Do** reserve categorical violet and the status hues for non-interactive meaning (KPI tiles, avatars, timeline dots, data state) — never as action colors.

### Don't:
- **Don't** ship the "AI SaaS marketing" aesthetic: no dark-mode-with-purple-gradients, no neon accents, no glassmorphism panels, no oversized hero type, no shadow-heavy floating-card soup.
- **Don't** put a drop shadow on a static card. If it isn't hovering, pressed, focused, or a true overlay, it gets a border instead (The Flat-By-Default Rule).
- **Don't** use `rgba(0,0,0,…)` at high opacity for shadows; shadow color is desaturated near-black at low alpha only.
- **Don't** introduce a second brand color, a new font, or a new border color. The palette is one blue + neutrals + status; the border is one value.
- **Don't** use mono or proportional figures for money in tables — money is Inter-`tabular`, IDs are mono.
- **Don't** color body text with a fully saturated status hue, or fill a status pill solid — use the tint + darkened-text pattern.
- **Don't** make interactive controls taller/shorter than 32px or invent radii outside the 4/6/8/10/999 scale.

## How to use these tokens (implementers)

The source ships these as **shadcn-vue HSL custom properties on `:root`**, consumed via `hsl(var(--token))` and `hsl(var(--token) / <alpha>)`. Preserve that pipeline in the React/Tailwind app:

1. **Define `:root` HSL triplets** (the bare `H S% L%` form, no `hsl()` wrapper) for every color token above, plus `--radius: 0.5rem`, `--rail-w: 224px`, `--header-h: 56px`. The frontmatter lists them pre-wrapped in `hsl()` for Stitch's hex-ish validator; the canonical runtime form is the bare triplet so alpha (`/ 0.1`) works.
2. **Map Tailwind theme** to the vars. This app is **Tailwind v4**, so map them in a CSS `@theme inline` block where each `--color-*` value is a **resolvable** color — `@theme inline { --color-background: hsl(var(--background)); --color-primary: hsl(var(--primary)); --color-primary-foreground: hsl(var(--primary-foreground)); … }` — and `--radius-lg: var(--radius); --radius-md: calc(var(--radius) - 2px); --radius-sm: calc(var(--radius) - 4px)`. **Do NOT append the v3 `/ <alpha-value>` placeholder** — v4 does not substitute it, so it emits invalid CSS the browser discards and every token utility silently renders nothing. The bare-triplet `:root` form (point 1) is what makes this work: v4 generates the `/<alpha>` modifier (`bg-primary/10`, `border-border/70`) automatically via `color-mix()` from the bare color. Add `warning`/`warning-foreground`, `success`/`success-foreground`, and the categorical `violet` — these are RIS additions beyond stock shadcn.
3. **Alpha tints** (`primary/10%`, `success/12%`, `border/70%`, etc.) come straight from the slash-alpha syntax — keep them; they are load-bearing for the tinted-status and hover-wash patterns.
4. **Numbers:** add a `tabular`/`tnum` utility (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; font-feature-settings: "tnum"`) and apply it to every metric.
5. **Focus:** keep the global `*:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid hsl(var(--ring)); outline-offset: 2px }` rather than per-component focus styles.
6. **Charts (recharts):** theme series/axes/grid from these tokens — axis/grid in `border`/`muted-foreground`, primary series in `primary`, status series in success/warning/destructive, categorical in violet. (No chart tokens existed in the mockups; derive from the palette, do not invent new chart colors.)

## Accessibility posture

- **Contrast:** `foreground` on `background`/`card` is ~AAA. `muted-foreground` (`46.1%` L) on white clears AA for body/secondary text. Status pills use **darkened text variants** (e.g. won text `hsl(142 64% 30%)`, lost `hsl(0 72% 45%)`, amber's deep-brown `warning-foreground`) specifically to clear AA on their light tinted backgrounds — preserve those darker text values; do not substitute the base status hue as pill text.
- **Focus:** single source of truth — global `:focus-visible` = `2px solid {colors.ring}` (the primary blue) at 2px offset. Every focusable element inherits it.
- **Semantics in source:** `aria-current="page"` on active nav, `role="tablist"/"tab"/"aria-selected"` on segmented filters and the layout switcher, `role="checkbox"/"aria-checked"/tabindex` on custom checkboxes, `aria-label` on icon-only buttons and section landmarks (`aria-label="Pipeline summary"`). Keep these; they are part of the system.
- **Keyboard:** tab order follows DOM (rail → header → main); custom checkboxes are `tabindex="0"`. Overlays (popover/toast/tooltip) are non-focus-trapping in the mockup — real implementations must add focus management and `Esc`-to-close (a build-time gap, not a token gap).
