#
# flock-run.sh — the SHARED flock-and-run core behind the machine-global mutex
# wrappers with-db-lock.sh / with-test-lock.sh (one core, not per-wrapper copies).
#
# Dependency-free: bash + python3 stdlib only. macOS ships no flock(1), which is
# why python3's fcntl is used — do NOT switch to flock(1). The lock is an ADVISORY
# OS lock (fcntl.flock) the kernel releases the instant the holding process exits
# (crash included), so there is never a stale lock to clean up.
#
# ── ACQUISITION ORDER (outermost first): db -> test ──────────────────────────
# When a command needs BOTH locks, acquire them in THIS order only, to avoid
# cross-lock deadlock. Each wrapper is independently re-entrant-safe via its OWN
# *_LOCK_HELD env var: the wrapper EXPORTS the var into the child env, and a
# script that self-wraps checks that var before re-wrapping so it never
# re-acquires its own outer hold. (The raw nested case
# `with-X-lock bash -c 'with-X-lock ...'` is NOT protected — do not nest a
# wrapper inside itself; self-wrap via the held-var check instead.)
#
# The lock files are MOS-scoped (~/.mos-*.lock): sibling projects on this host
# run their own stacks under their own locks — neither waits on, nor resets, the
# other's.
#
# Invoked by the wrappers (not normally by hand):
#   flock-run.sh <label> <lock_path> <timeout> <held_env_var> <waiting_desc> -- <command...>
# label         short tag for stderr lines, e.g. "db-lock"
# lock_path     file to flock
# timeout       0 = wait forever; >0 = give up (exit 75 / EX_TEMPFAIL) after N seconds
# held_env_var  env var name to export=1 into the child so a self-wrap detects the hold
# waiting_desc  human phrase for the "waiting for ..." line
# command...    the command to run under the lock (stdio inherited, incl. real stdin)
#
# Exit codes: the wrapped command's rc; 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) on timeout; 2 on misuse.
